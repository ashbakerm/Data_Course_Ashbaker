With the Education & Career Success dataset from Kaggle, I will look at how different factors like degree level, field of study, GPA, and work experience influence professional success. The dataset has structured data with numerical and categorical variables like figures, education levels (high school, bachelor’s, master’s, PhD), years of experience, job industries, and demographic information like age and gender.      Potential sources for supplementary data could include government labor statistics (e.g., U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics), LinkedIn salary insights, or industry-specific reports. I hope to determine whether formal education is the key driver of success or if alternative factors like experience and skills play a more significant role.
